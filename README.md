# Password Generator

Deployed link: https://djbowen95.github.io/password-generator/

## Description

This application will generate a completely random password for the user. It asks the user a series of prompts to allow them to customise their random password, deciding which characters will be included (capitals, lowercase, numeric values, special characters) and the length of their password (between 8 and 128). It is built in vanilla Javascript, with simple DOM alerts to prompt the user questions about their password. The single page application has simple HTML / CSS, which was given as starter code by the University of Birmingham Coding Bootcamp.

This was created early into my Bootcamp experience: but I have updated this README to reflect some ideas on how I might develop this project a little further, to show off skills I have learned since building this project and want to practice on a simple project.
