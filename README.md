<h2 align="center"> Secure Password Generator. <i> Version 1.0.0 </i> </h2>
<strong>Signature</strong> is a randomised password generator that allows users to create and customise a secure password whenever they need one. Built in vanilla JavaScript and housed in a simple HTML5/CSS3 web page, it queries the user with a series of dialogue prompts - asking them which character types they would like to include (lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and special characters) and the length of password they require. It then returns the password and displays it on the webpage for them.

This project was built for the University of Birmingham Coding Bootcamp, in the third week of the course, and the first full-stack JavaScript project I made. It is fairly simple - do take a look at my profile for more complex projects I've built since!

## Key Features
I plan to expand on this with short summaries of the features this project demonstrates and GIFs/code snippets that capture what I did. In the mean time, here are notes of some of the particular things I did/used:
- CSS flexbox (nav bar, containers)
- Responsive design (flexbox but also media queries)
- Pseudo-classes (also wanna look at weeks 1 - 3 to try include everything)
- (Not there yet but aim to make sure there is animation)
- JavaScript Math library/object for randomisation
- Iterators / array methods (concat especially)
- Browser compatible JavaScript (no modularisation)

## Contribution
This is a small portfolio project design to show my personal grasp of the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and as such, I am not looking for pull requests / collaborative contributions. I do, however, welcome any suggestions of small upgrades or features I could integrate into my existing application. Please feel free to submit suggestions as an issue if you would like to contribute an idea.

## Version History
### 1.0.0 BootCamp Project
I want to keep a short account of what the project looked like when I first built it here. I have some images in the 'development images' folder to add when I fill out this section.
