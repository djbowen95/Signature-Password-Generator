<strong>Signature Password Generator</strong> is a simple web application that generates secure, random passwords. It is built in <strong>JavaScript</strong>, with simple functions that use the <strong><em>built in Math library</em></strong> and <strong><em>assorted array methods</em></strong> to provide users with a <strong><em>unique character string</em></strong>. The user interface is built in  <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS<em> with responsive design</em></strong>: it uses <strong><em>flexbox</em></strong> and <strong><em>media queries</em></strong> to achieve a great user experience on any device.<br/><br/>

This project was built for the <strong><em>University of Birmingham and 2U/Trilogy Web Development Coding Bootcamp</em></strong>, in the third week of the course. It is a very simple project; I've built far more complex applications since...but I'd still love you take a look at <strong><em>my very first JavaScript project</em></strong>, and read about the things I learned on my first steps towards becoming a <strong><em>full-stack developer</em></strong>.

## Key Features
I plan to expand on this with short summaries of the features this project demonstrates and GIFs/code snippets that capture what I did. In the mean time, here are notes of some of the particular things I did/used:
- CSS flexbox (nav bar, containers)
- Responsive design (flexbox but also media queries)
- Pseudo-classes (also wanna look at weeks 1 - 3 to try include everything)
- (Not there yet but aim to make sure there is animation)
- JavaScript Math library/object for randomisation
- Iterators / array methods (concat especially)
- Browser compatible JavaScript (no modularisation)

## Version History
### 1.0.0 BootCamp Project
I want to keep a short account of what the project looked like when I first built it here. I have some images in the 'development images' folder to add when I fill out this section. 

## Contribution
This is a small portfolio project and while I have a few more ideas for its development, I would generally consider it to be finished. I am not actively seeking collaborative contribution but I am always open to hearing ideas! If there's a feature you'd like to see, or you'd like to help build, I'd love to hear your idea. Please open an issue and outline it! I'll be sure to get back to you as soon as I can.
