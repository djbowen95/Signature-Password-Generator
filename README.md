Created the first five lines of code - an empty array for all the available password characters, and 4 arrays containing: uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters.

The idea is that I will get the prompt box to ask:
"Which kind of characters would you like to include?"
"Numbers, Uppercase Letters, Lowercase Letters, Special Characters"

Problems from first session working:
    - Not sure how to change HTML/CSS page display at all
    - not sure how to do if without else (maybe just 'if')
