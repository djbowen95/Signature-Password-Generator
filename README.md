# Password Generator

Deployed link: https://djbowen95.github.io/password-generator/

## Description

This application will generate a completely random password for the user. It asks the user a series of prompts to allow them to customise their random password, deciding which characters will be included (capitals, lowercase, numeric values, special characters) and the length of their password (between 8 and 128). It is built in vanilla Javascript, with simple DOM alerts to prompt the user questions about their password. The single page application has simple HTML / CSS, which was given as starter code by the University of Birmingham Coding Bootcamp.

This was created early into my Bootcamp experience: but I have updated this README to reflect some ideas on how I might develop this project a little further, to show off skills I have learned since building this project and want to practice on a simple project.

## Usage
The deployed application can be found here: https://djbowen95.github.io/password-generator/  

Click the 'generate' button to start the script. The script will command the browser to ask you a series of prompts (which character types do you want in your password, how long would you like the password to be).

Once the prompts have been answered, the generated password should appear in the empty field. Click 'generate' below to generate a new password / start the process over again. 

## Further Development
These are some simple ideas I have for further development:
 - Redesign the page using a CSS framework, probably Bulma
 - Rather than prompts, use either modals or changing / reactive fields / boxes
 - Animate - so each time a password is generated a card 'flips'
 - Use React so that password length, etc can be stored in state
 - Use a smart / formal design, using blacks + greys, and maybe blues, to indicate trustworthiness
 - Bring in a font rather than the default Bulma font
 - "Learn more" page that teaches about cyber security basic principles, ie. a password manager, that password/security checking website, following leaks + changing passwords
 - Option to save passwords (?)
 - Copy to clipboard button
 - "Rate my password" webpage (completely different program)
 - Tidy / refactor code - surely there is a simple way to do this entire thing
 - Put into typescript / write new function logic in typescript, to practice / learn new technology

 Order:
 - Copy to clipboard button
 - Design overall layout with Figma (?) and Bulma: generate password page
 - Main card: flip animation
 - Design animations for other inputs
 - Design layout for 'more information' page

 - Tidy, refactor and update code
 - Make it into TypeScript - for password updating functions at least

 - Build React app
 - React store changes in the state
 - React change between two pages
 - Animate change between pages
 - Host React application (heroku? not sure - look it up)

 - Bring in sensible google fonts
 - Recolour to a professional + secure colour scheme.

Longer term ideas:
 - Make this into a password manager that plugs into the browser, potentially pops up as a modal over the page
 - Saves passwords to a database
 - Reminders for when a password needs changing (email, notifications)
 - Greater customisability with a special character keyboard that is both keyboard and click responsive
